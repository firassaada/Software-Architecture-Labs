# Hackaton Architecture :

-Implementing the EVAX platform using the MVP architecture allows for a clear separation of concerns and expedited development during the hackathon. Here's a simplified overview of the features we can implement with this architecture:

    Model: Manages data related to appointments, doctors, users, and vaccines. Provides methods to fetch data from the backend.

    View: Handles the user interface, displaying appointment schedules, doctor information, vaccine details, and user profiles.

    Presenter: Acts as an intermediary between the Model and View. Fetches data from the Model and updates the View accordingly. Handles user interactions and business logic.

-Features we can implement:

    *Appointment Scheduling
    *Doctor Listing:
    *Vaccine Information:
    *User Authentication
    *Error Handling:
